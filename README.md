**Data and Model Availability Notice:**

1. **Complete Triplet Dataset:** Due to GitHub's 25MB file size limit, the complete triplet dataset used for model training is hosted on an external platform (https://zenodo.org/login/).
2. **Dataset Splits:** Similarly, the dataset split file (`splits\train.tsv`) exceeds the size limit and can be accessed via the same platform (https://zenodo.org/login/).
3. **Trained Models:** The trained graph embedding model file (`trained_model.pkl`) related to this paper is also too large for this repository and will be publicly available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/login/).
4. **Current Status:** The authors are currently resolving the platform's upload limitations. All relevant data and model files will be fully uploaded to Zenodo shortly. If you have an urgent need for these files, please feel free to contact the author directly for advance access.
